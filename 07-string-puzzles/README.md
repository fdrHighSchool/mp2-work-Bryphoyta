# String Puzzles
#### Respond to the following:

1. *In your own words*, discuss what each String method does:
  * `.substring(a)`
    * Takes a part of the string out as a seperate string up to the index

  * `.substring(a, b)`
    * Takes the part of the string as a seperate string between the 2 indexs

  * `.indexOf(str)`
    * Tells you the index of the letter in the word

  * `.equals(str)`
    * Checks if the string you put is the same as the string in the parantheses


2. *In your own words*, discuss what the following `for` loop accomplishes for `String s`:
```
for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
      // DO STUFF
}
```
  * The for loop defines i as 0 and goes through the code in the for loop if i is below the length of the string s.
    It then repeats and adds 1 to i EX: 0+1 = 1
