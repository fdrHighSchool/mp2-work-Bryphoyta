#### Respond to the following:

1. Write a plan for the following output:
```
000111222333444555666777888999
000111222333444555666777888999
000111222333444555666777888999
```
I would make a method that is void with 1 int variable. There would be 1 for loop. It would print "000111222333444555666777888999" everytime i is lower  
than the variable you enter.


2. Write a plan for the following output:
```
999998888877777666665555544444333332222211111
999998888877777666665555544444333332222211111
999998888877777666665555544444333332222211111
999998888877777666665555544444333332222211111
999998888877777666665555544444333332222211111
```

This would be a method where it prints "999998888877777666665555544444333332222211111" however times you want to put as a index in a for loop. i in the loop counts the number amount of times it has printed, and when it finally is greater or equal to the variable it ends
